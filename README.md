# Project Title : Infection Mushroom
InfectionMushroom is a tool that simulates the spread of an infection in a mushroom colony. 
This can be useful for studying the spread of diseases in populations.



## Description
The purpose of this project was to mimic how a ringworm infection would spread over a skin area of size N x N cells. In the center is the original infected skin cell. An infected cell has a 50% chance of infecting any healthy cells nearby at each time interval. After six units of time, the infected cell develops an immunity to infection; this immunity lasts for the following four units of time, after which the cell recovers its health. During the simulation of the described process, indicate the current condition of the simulated skin area at each time interval, taking note of infected, immune, and healthy cells.
